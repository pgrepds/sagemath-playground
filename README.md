# sagemath-bootcamp

This repository represents my playground for exploring the beautiful software system SageMath which plays a fundamental role in all of my research. The code does not follow any particular structure and is most likely not up to date.

The code might be given in the form of Jupyter notebooks, standalone Python scripts which use the Sage library or by writing interpreted and compiled programs in Sage directly. The last option will most likely stay an exception.

For a standalone Python script, we usually follow the offical documentation which describes the setup [here](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/programming.html#section-standalone).

In this readme file we try to document some of the features which we are using most of the time.
